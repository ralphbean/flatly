A pyramid scaffold that is flat.  Kind of like Flask.

A friend was complaining that Pyramid had "too many things" and wasn't
flat and simple like Flask.  It wasn't that there were too many things
in the framework itself.. its that by default, projects created from
templates or scaffold had too many files and too many pieces.

This is the simplest Pyramid scaffold that I could come up with.
